# Sarcasm Detection in Tweets

I made this project in the sixth semester for the course, "Information Retrieval", alongside my teammates, Huzaifa Jawad and Muhammad Ahmed Ahsan Bawany.

The goal of this project was to classify tweets as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. We trained our model on a dataset of tweets (provided by our professor) in which each tweet was marked as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.

Once the program is executed, the user is asked to enter a sentence. The model then predicts whether it is sarcastic or not. The model was successful, giving an accuracy of 80% and precision of 82%.
